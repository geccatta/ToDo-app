# To-Do Application (MyTaskBoard)
## Summary:
 Hello, this is my Demo version of To-Do application based on React. It's called MyTaskBoard. It consists of 2 pages - Home & ViewAll pages.
Home page displays the main page of the application which could undergo future changes and addition of more functionalities, while the ViewAll page
holds [data fetched from a public API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos). Through an HTTP request to this API the list of todos is retrieved
when the app is loaded.
